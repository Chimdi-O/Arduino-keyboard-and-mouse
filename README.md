This repo is The arduino code in C++ and the accompanying python code for a keyboard and mouse 
The Arduino uno is unable to directly be used as a keyboard so using pyserial the inputs from the arduino uno are processed and made into keyboard inputs 
The main problems with this project is the latency in the inputs and gravity interfers with the readings from the accelerometer
